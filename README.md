Some people dismiss genAI agents as [_stochastic parrots_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_parrot), but I see them more like that classic brother-in-law at a family gathering: the guy who’s got an opinion on everything—and isn’t shy about sharing it, loudly and with absolute confidence. Yet, deep down, your brother-in-law just wants to connect. He’s nervously rambling about things he barely grasps, fueled by genuine excitement.  
So, hear him out. Lean in. You might pick up something new—or even get something done together.
